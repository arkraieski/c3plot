Description: Create interactive plots with the 'C3.js' <https://c3js.org/> charting library using 
    an interface modeled after that of base graphics. The main c3plot() function is an
    S3 generic with methods for various R objects that work similarly to their equivalent plot() methods. 
    These plots can be embedded into 'Shiny' web applications
    or 'R Markdown' documents or displayed within the 'RStudio' 'Viewer' pane.
